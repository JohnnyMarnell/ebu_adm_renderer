Command-Line Tools
------------------

The EAR reference implementation comes with two command line tools:

|ear-render|_
    Is the main tool to render BW64/ADM audio files

|ear-utils|_
    Collection of useful ADM utilities

.. |ear-render| replace:: ``ear-render``
.. |ear-utils| replace:: ``ear-utils``

.. _ear-render:

``ear-render``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To render an ADM file, the following three parameters must be given:

- ``-s`` followed by the target output format to render to
- the name of the input file
- the name of the output file

For example, ``ear-render -s 0+5+0 input.wav output_surround.wav`` will render
the BW64/ADM file ``input.wav`` to a ``0+5+0`` target speaker layout and store
the result in ``output_surround.wav``. See :ref:`output_format` for details of
the output file format.

.. argparse::
   :module: ear.cmdline.render_file
   :func: make_parser
   :prog: ear-render
   :nodescription:

   -l, --layout
       See :ref:`speakers_file`.

.. _ear-utils:

``ear-utils``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``ear-utils`` command contains a collection of utilities for working with
ADM files as sub-commands.

.. argparse::
   :module: ear.cmdline.utils
   :func: make_parser
   :prog: ear-utils

   --screen
       See :ref:`speakers_file`.

.. _output_format:

Output Format
-------------

The output of ``ear-render`` is a BW64 file containing one channel for each
loudspeaker in the specified layout.

The channel order is the same as in the "Loudspeaker configuration" tables in
BS.2051-2 (e.g. table 4 for 0+5+0).

The output may need further processing before being played back on loudspeakers.

In particular, the renderer does not do any bass management -- LFE channels in
the output must be treated according to section 3 or 4 of attachment 1 to annex
7 of BS.775-4. This includes the addition of a 10dB gain, and routing to
loudspeakers or a subwoofer.

The renderer also does not apply any kind of loudspeaker distance compensation
(beyond the gain which may be specified in the speakers file), or EQ.

To illustrate this, if the input to the renderer exactly matches the output
loudspeaker layout, then the output will be identical to the input.

.. _speakers_file:

Speakers File Format
--------------------

Information about the loudspeaker layout can be passed to the renderer
by using a speakers file with the ``--speakers`` flag.

File Format
~~~~~~~~~~~

A speakers file is a `YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`__
document, which contains a list of loudspeakers under the ``speakers``
key, and the screen information under the ``screen`` key. Either may be
omitted if not required.

Speakers list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The top level ``speakers`` item should contain a sequence of mappings,
one for each output loudspeaker.

Each mapping should look something like this:

.. code:: yaml

   - {channel: 7, names: M+000, position: {az: 0.0, el: 0.0, r: 2.0 }}

which defines a loudspeaker connected to channel 7 (zero based),
assigned to M+000 (in bs.2051 terms), with a given position. The file
should contain a sequence of lines as above; one line per speaker.

The possible keys are as follows:

``channel`` (required)
    The zero-based output channel number.

``names`` (required)
    A list (or a single string) of BS.2051 channel names that this speaker
    should handle, i.e.Â like ``M+000`` or ``[U+180, UH+180]``.

``position`` (optional)
    A mapping containing the real loudspeaker position, with keys ``az``,
    ``el`` and ``r`` specifying the azimuth, elevation and distance of the
    loudspeaker in ADM angle format (anticlockwise azimuth, degrees) and
    metres. Note that the radius specified is not used to apply distance
    compensation.

``gain_linear`` (optional)
    A linear gain to apply to this output channel; this is useful for LFE
    outputs.

Screen
^^^^^^

The top level ``screen`` item should contain a mapping, with at least a
``type`` key, and the following options, depending on the type. If the
screen key is omitted, the default polar screen position specified in
BS.2076-1 will be assumed. If a null screen is specified, then
screen-related processing will not be applied.

if ``type == "polar"``
''''''''''''''''''''''

``aspectRatio`` (required)
    Screen width divided by screen height

``centrePosition`` (required)
    Polar position of the centre of the screen, in the same format as the
    speaker ``position`` attribute.

``widthAzimuth`` (required)
    Width of the screen in degrees.

if ``type == "cart"``
'''''''''''''''''''''

``aspectRatio`` (required)
    Screen width divided by screen height

``centrePosition`` (required)
    Cartesian position of the centre of the screen; a mapping with keys ``X``,
    ``Y`` and ``Z``.

``widthX`` (required)
    Width of the screen in Cartesian coordinates.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Useful speakers files should be stored in ``ear/doc/speakers_files/``.

A minimal example with a polar screen would look like:

.. code:: yaml

   speakers:
       - {channel: 0, names: M+030, position: {az: 30.0, el: 0.0, r: 2.0 }}
       - {channel: 1, names: M-030, position: {az: -30.0, el: 0.0, r: 2.0 }}
   screen:
       type: polar
       aspectRatio: 1.78
       centrePosition: {az: 0.0, el: 0.0, r: 1.0}
       widthAzimuth: 58.0

A minimal example with a Cartesian screen would look like:

.. code:: yaml

   speakers:
       - {channel: 0, names: M+030, position: {az: 30.0, el: 0.0, r: 2.0 }}
       - {channel: 1, names: M-030, position: {az: -30.0, el: 0.0, r: 2.0 }}
   screen:
       type: cart
       aspectRatio: 1.78
       centrePosition: {X: 0.0, Y: 1.0, Z: 0.0}
       widthX: 0.5

A minimal example with screen processing disabled:

.. code:: yaml

   speakers:
       - {channel: 0, names: M+030, position: {az: 30.0, el: 0.0, r: 2.0 }}
       - {channel: 1, names: M-030, position: {az: -30.0, el: 0.0, r: 2.0 }}
   screen: null
